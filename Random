In June 2016, The DAO, a platform for the autonomous governance of investment capital, was found to contain an unexpected code path which would allow any sophisticated user to withdraw an arbitrary amount of funds from the DAO. This was indeed exploited by an unknown party on the 16th of June, who managed to move about one third of the Ether held then by the DAO (at the time valued at 50 million USD) into a clone of the DAO, a "ChildDAO" whose control was held by only this party.[12][13] As a consequence of the way the DAO was programmed, these moved funds would remain unavailable for withdrawal for about a month.[14]

The Ethereum community debated how and whether to reclaim the ether, and whether to shut down The DAO,[14] as the decentralised nature of The DAO and of Ethereum meant a lack of a central authority that could take quick action, instead requiring community consensus.[13] After a few weeks' discussion, The DAO was shut down, and Ethereum hard-forked (a backward-incompatible change[15]) to reverse the hack and return The DAO funds, with some controversy.[16] This was the first fork of any mainstream blockchain to be for the purpose of making reparations to investors in a failed enterprise.[15]
